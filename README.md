# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews 

A project for the course Linear Regression Models.  The project begins with tokenization, following the usage of tokens in conjunction with Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency), and LSA/I (Latent Semantic Analysis/Indexing techniques) for feature extraction. Afterwards, algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Linear regression are to be employed to analyse the extracted features and classify the reviews based on their sentiment polarity. Currently, we only have a demo version of this project in R and the Python version is in progress.
